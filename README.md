## Problems

### Styled components

has not do fast refresh, read the [documentation](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/styling#css-in-js-libraries), I did step by step and work wrong.

### Components

I don't know, the action method work in another project, but in this not, like action method is missing
